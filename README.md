# Bridges_Examples
A collection of python examples using the Bridges library http://bridgesuncc.github.io/index.html for visualising data structures. 

These examples use the dotenv library https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/ to keep username and API key out of the examples. This adds a .env file with the Bridges username and API KEY for use in each file.

Install and use as follows:
1. Create an account on Bridges so that you have your username and API KEY which you need for each of your programmes.
2. Install python https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download 
3. Install pip for your platform https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/ 
5. Install bridges using pip with: 

        python3 -m pip install bridges

You're now ready to get started using Bridges.
